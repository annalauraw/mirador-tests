# Customization tests with mirador-workshop

This is a repository set up by Annabelle Wiegart in order to get started with the customization of the Mirador viewer and to be able to get help from IIIF community. It is based on the [mirador-workshop](https://github.com/ProjectMirador/mirador-workshop) repository.
